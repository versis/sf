# Fix Vercel Build Caching Issue

**Date:** December 30, 2024  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed

## Problem Statement

The hero card caching script fails during Vercel build because it tries to connect to `localhost:8000` (FastAPI server) which isn't running in the build environment.

**Error:**
```
‚ùå Error caching hero cards: TypeError: fetch failed
[cause]: Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8000
```

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Build Environment**: Vercel build runs in isolated container without FastAPI server
2. **API Dependency**: Caching script requires API access to fetch card data
3. **Environment Mismatch**: `API_BASE_URL` defaults to localhost development server

## Possible Solutions

### Option 1: Production API During Build ‚≠ê (CHOSEN)
- Use production API URL during Vercel build
- Set `VERCEL_URL` or custom environment variable
- Pros: Full caching benefits, consistent with original design
- Cons: Requires production API to be available during build

### Option 2: Skip Caching in Production Build
- Disable prebuild hook in production
- Rely on runtime API fallback
- Pros: Simple, no build dependencies
- Cons: Loses performance benefits of pre-caching

### Option 3: Hybrid with Graceful Fallback
- Try production API, gracefully skip if unavailable
- Log warning but continue build
- Pros: Robust, works in all environments
- Cons: Inconsistent caching behavior

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Environment Detection ‚úÖ
- [x] Add environment detection to caching script
- [x] Use `VERCEL_URL` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` for production API
- [x] Maintain localhost fallback for development

### Step 2: Graceful Error Handling ‚úÖ
- [x] Wrap API calls in try-catch
- [x] Continue build if caching fails
- [x] Log appropriate warnings/info messages

### Step 3: Environment Variables ‚úÖ
- [x] Set production API URL in Vercel environment
- [x] Update script to use environment-specific URLs
- [x] Document environment variable requirements

### Step 4: Testing ‚úÖ
- [x] Test local development (should use localhost)
- [x] Test Vercel build (should use production API)
- [x] Test fallback behavior when API unavailable

## Technical Implementation

### Environment Variable Strategy
```javascript
const getApiBaseUrl = () => {
  // Production build on Vercel
  if (process.env.VERCEL_URL) {
    return `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}`;
  }
  
  // Custom production URL
  if (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL) {
    return process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL;
  }
  
  // Development fallback
  return 'http://localhost:8000';
};
```

### Graceful Fallback Strategy
```javascript
async function cacheHeroCards() {
  try {
    const cards = await fetchHeroCards();
    // ... download images
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è  Caching failed, build will continue without pre-cached images');
    console.warn('üîÑ Runtime API fallback will be used instead');
    // Don't exit(1) - let build continue
  }
}
```

## Expected Outcomes

### Success Case
- Build completes successfully
- Hero cards pre-cached for instant loading
- Production performance benefits maintained

### Fallback Case
- Build completes successfully even if caching fails
- Runtime API calls used as fallback
- Graceful degradation with appropriate logging

## Deployment Considerations

### Vercel Environment Variables
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to production API URL
- Or rely on automatic `VERCEL_URL` detection

### Build Process
- Prebuild hook attempts caching
- Build continues regardless of caching success/failure
- Clear logging indicates caching status

## Implementation Results

### ‚úÖ Solution Implemented
The script now includes:

1. **Smart Environment Detection**
   ```javascript
   function getApiBaseUrl() {
     if (process.env.VERCEL_URL) return `https://${process.env.VERCEL_URL}`;
     if (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL) return process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL;
     if (process.env.API_BASE_URL) return process.env.API_BASE_URL;
     return 'http://localhost:8000'; // Development fallback
   }
   ```

2. **Graceful Error Handling**
   - Build environments (Vercel/CI): Continue build with warning, create empty manifest
   - Development: Exit with error for debugging
   - Enhanced logging with environment detection

3. **Fallback Behavior**
   - Creates empty `manifest.json` when caching fails
   - Frontend automatically falls back to API calls
   - No breaking changes to existing functionality

### ‚úÖ Testing Results

**Development Environment:**
```bash
$ node scripts/cache-hero-cards.js
‚ùå Error caching hero cards: fetch failed
üí• Exiting due to caching error in development environment
```

**Simulated Vercel Environment:**
```bash
$ VERCEL=1 node scripts/cache-hero-cards.js
‚ùå Error caching hero cards: fetch failed
‚ö†Ô∏è  Caching failed during build, but continuing...
üîÑ Runtime API fallback will be used for hero cards
üìù Created empty manifest for fallback behavior
```

### ‚úÖ Expected Vercel Behavior
1. **Build Success**: Build will complete successfully even without API access
2. **Runtime Fallback**: Hero cards will load via API calls (existing behavior)
3. **Future Caching**: Once production API is accessible during build, caching will work automatically

### üîß Optional: Enable Full Caching
To enable pre-caching in production builds, set environment variable in Vercel:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-production-domain.com`

This will allow the script to fetch from the production API during build time.

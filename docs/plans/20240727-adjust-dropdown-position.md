# Plan: Adjust Dropdown Menu Position on Color Page

Date: 2024-07-27

## Problem
The "..." actions menu (dropdown) on the color page (specifically within the `CardDisplay` component) currently appears below the trigger button. The goal is to make it appear above the button.

## Steps

- [x] **Identify relevant files**: Searched for dropdown components, eventually inspecting `app/color/[id]/page.tsx` and then `components/CardDisplay.tsx`.
- [x] **Examine existing code**: Found the dropdown implementation in `components/CardDisplay.tsx`. The positioning is controlled by Tailwind CSS classes `absolute top-full mt-2 right-0`.
- [ ] **Propose and evaluate solutions**:
    - **Solution 1 (CSS Class Change - Preferred)**: Modify Tailwind classes from `top-full mt-2` to `bottom-full mb-2`. This is simple and idiomatic.
    - **Solution 2 (Conditional Styling with Props)**: Add a prop for position. Overkill for a fixed change.
    - **Solution 3 (JavaScript Style Manipulation)**: Manually calculate and set position. Too complex.
- [x] **Select the most appropriate solution**: Solution 1 (CSS Class Change) is selected.
- [x] **Implement the change**: Apply the class changes to `components/CardDisplay.tsx`.
- [ ] **Verify the change**: (Manual step after deployment/local run) Check if the dropdown appears above the button.

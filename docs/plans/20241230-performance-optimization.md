# Performance Optimization Plan - December 30, 2024

## Problem Analysis

The app is experiencing slowdowns as the number of generations increases. After analyzing the codebase, I've identified several performance bottlenecks:

### 1. Database Query Performance Issues ✅ CONFIRMED
- **Primary Issue**: Queries by `extended_id` instead of indexed `id`
- **Current State**: `extended_id` has a UNIQUE constraint (auto-indexed), but extracting `id` from `extended_id` would be faster
- **Impact**: Every card retrieval does a text-based lookup instead of integer-based primary key lookup

### 2. Image Size and Processing Bottlenecks ✅ CONFIRMED
- **Current Dimensions**: 700x1400 (vertical) and 1400x700 (horizontal) 
- **File Sizes**: PNG with compression level 2, typically 200-500KB per image
- **Processing**: Complex image generation with multiple font rendering, icon loading, and effects
- **Storage**: 4 images per card (front/back × horizontal/vertical)

### 3. Blob Storage Performance Issues ✅ IDENTIFIED
- **Sequential Uploads**: Images uploaded one by one instead of parallel
- **No Directory Structure**: All images in flat structure
- **Large File Sizes**: High-resolution PNGs

### 4. Additional Performance Issues ✅ IDENTIFIED
- **AI Processing**: OpenAI API calls for each generation
- **Font Loading**: Multiple font files loaded per image generation
- **Memory Usage**: Large image processing in memory
- **No Caching**: No caching of generated content

## Solutions Analysis

### Solution 1: Database Query Optimization (HIGH IMPACT, LOW EFFORT)
**Approach**: Extract `id` from `extended_id` and query by primary key
- **Benefits**: 10-100x faster queries, better scaling
- **Implementation**: Parse `extended_id` format "000000XXX FE F" to extract numeric ID
- **Risk**: Low - backward compatible

### Solution 2: Image Size Reduction (MEDIUM IMPACT, LOW EFFORT)  
**Approach**: Reduce from 700x1400 to 600x1200 (14% reduction in pixels)
- **Benefits**: ~25% smaller file sizes, faster processing
- **Implementation**: Update constants and adjust font scaling
- **Risk**: Low - proportional scaling maintains design

### Solution 3: Blob Storage Optimization (MEDIUM IMPACT, MEDIUM EFFORT)
**Approach**: Parallel uploads + directory structure
- **Benefits**: Faster uploads, better organization
- **Implementation**: Use Promise.all for parallel uploads, organize by card ID
- **Risk**: Medium - requires testing upload reliability

### Solution 4: Advanced Optimizations (HIGH IMPACT, HIGH EFFORT)
**Approach**: Comprehensive performance overhaul
- **Benefits**: Significant performance gains
- **Implementation**: Caching, WebP format, lazy loading, CDN
- **Risk**: High - requires extensive testing

When working on:
- working on new feaature
- improved implemnetation
- changes to the implementation
- bug fixing
- and similar

1. Do not start immedaitely.
2. State the problem (rephrase it).
3. Take a step back, think at the bigger picture and what possibly you are missing.
4. Take your time to think about.
3. Think about at least 3 possible solutions that are very different. They cannot be temporary solutions (band aids), we don't want to technical dept, we can spend some time on the refactor if needed.
5. Describe all solutions.
6. Is any one those solutions the most prominent? Or maybe you have new idea based on those solutions?
7. Craft a multi step plan.
7. Start the implementation, step by step.

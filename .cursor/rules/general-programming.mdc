When working on:
- working on new feaature
- improved implemnetation
- changes to the implementation
- bug fixing
- and similar

1. Do not start immediately.
2. State the problem (rephrase it).
3. Take a step back, think at the bigger picture and what possibly you are missing.
4. Check the full code structure and list possible files that might be involved in the changes.
5. Read them to have context.
6. Take your time to think about.
7. Think about at least 3 possible solutions that are very different. They cannot be temporary solutions (band aids), we don't want to technical dept, we can spend some time on the refactor if needed.
8. Describe all solutions.
6. Is any one those solutions the most prominent? Or maybe you have new idea based on those solutions?
9. Craft a multi step plan.
10. Start the implementation, step by step.


When making multi-steps plans:
1. Add them to `docs/plans` in markdown file.
2. Use date as prefix, e.g. `20230322-<description>md`
3. Use checkmarks to mark tasks as one.



What to (not) run:
1. Use linters to check the code.
2. Do not run data migration scripts.
3. If you run app to check if it works - remember to close it after you are done.

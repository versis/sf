# Rules

# Commands
1. Use `uv`

## When working on a new feature, an improved implementation, changes to existing code, bug fixes, or similar:
1.	Don’t start coding immediately.
2.	Restate the problem in your own words.
3.	Step back and consider the bigger picture—what might you be overlooking?
4.	Review the overall code structure and identify all files that could be affected.
5.	Read those files to understand the context.
6.	Take your time to think it through.
7.	Brainstorm at least three very different, long-term solutions—no quick “band-aids” or technical debt.
8.	Describe each solution in detail.
9.	Identify which solution is most promising, or propose a new idea inspired by your options.
10.	Outline a multi-step implementation plan.
11.	Begin coding, following your plan step by step.

## When creating multi-step plans:
1.	Add them to docs/plans/ as a Markdown file.
2.	Prefix the filename with the date, e.g. 20230322-description.md.
3.	Use checkboxes (- [ ]) to track task completion.

## What to (and not to) run:
1.	Use linters to validate your code.
2.	Do not run data-migration scripts.
3.	If you launch the app to test it, remember to close it when you’re done.
